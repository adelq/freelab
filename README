INSTALLATION

I developed this software on a machine running Ubuntu Linux, but it should work on
any system that has Ruby and libusb. If you want to use the GUI code I wrote, you'll
also need the GTK2 library for Ruby. On an Ubuntu machine, the following command will
install all the stuff you need:
  sudo apt-get install ruby libusb-ruby libgtk2-ruby

If you're running Linux, you may also need to disable the vstusb kernel module, which
is still being distributed with a lot of Linuxes but which Vernier no longer recommends
using. For Ubuntu, I believe it was distributed with Ubuntu Lucid Lynx (10.04) but removed
before Maverick Meerkat (10.10). If the file /dev/vstusb0 exists on your system, then you
have vstusb installed. To disable vstusb temporarily, do this:
  sudo modprobe -r vstusb
To disable it permanently, edit the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf and add the
following line:
  blacklist vstusb

USE FROM THE COMMAND LINE

Examples:
    ruby -e 'require "vernier.rb"; l=LabPro.new; p=Photogate.new(l); sleep 10; print p.dt.join(" "); l.reset'
    ruby -e 'require "vernier.rb"; l=LabPro.new; p=Photogate.new(l); sleep 10; print p.pendulum.join(" "); l.reset'
The first example collects data from a photogate for 10 seconds, and prints out a list of the lengths of time
for which it was blocked. The second one does something similar in pendulum mode.

GUI

The sample program in the file "photogate" collects data from a photogate, printing out the time for which
it is blocked.
