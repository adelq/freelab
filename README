INSTALLATION

I developed this software on a machine running Ubuntu Linux, but it should work on
any system that has Ruby and libusb. If you want to use the GUI code I wrote, you'll
also need the GTK2 library for Ruby. On an Ubuntu machine, the following command will
install all the stuff you need:
  sudo apt-get install ruby libusb-ruby libgtk2-ruby

USE FROM THE COMMAND LINE

Examples:
    ruby -e 'require "vernier.rb"; l=LabPro.new; p=Photogate.new(l); sleep 10; print p.dt.join(" "); l.reset'
    ruby -e 'require "vernier.rb"; l=LabPro.new; p=Photogate.new(l); sleep 10; print p.pendulum.join(" "); l.reset'
The first example collects data from a photogate for 10 seconds, and prints out a list of the lengths of time
for which it was blocked. The second one does something similar in pendulum mode.

GUI

The sample program in the file "photogate" collects data from a photogate, printing out the time for which
it is blocked. You can run it using the command "ruby photogate".
